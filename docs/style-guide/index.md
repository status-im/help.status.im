The Status writing style guide aims to provide easy-to-follow guidelines for writing clear and well-structured documentation. Writers or contributors can use this guide for 90% of their needs; for the remaining 10%, use the [Microsoft Style Guide :octicons-tab-external-16:][microsoft-style-guide]{:target="_blank"}.

This guide does not contain lengthy linguistic explanations. Instead, it is intended to be a simple, real-world resource for anyone willing to contribute to the Status documentation, from writers ready to document product functionalities to casual contributors who want to improve the existing content.

The [first part](style-guidelines.md) of this guide describes general style guidelines. In the [second part](./structuring-the-content.md), you can find the different types of articles in the Status documentation, including directions on structuring your content. The [final part](./style-conventions.md) serves as a reference to the different styles in the Status documentation.

Refer to our [documentation contributor's guide][contributors-guide] to contribute to this guide or the Status documentation.

!!! note
    The Status writing style guide doesn't include information on writing developer documentation. This information will be included in a future version.
