# Edit and delete your messages

Instead of a centralized server, Status uses a peer-to-peer network to store and display messages. This means that if you want to edit or delete your message, you'll need other members' Status apps to process and apply these changes.

!!! note ""
    Be careful with information you share, especially in public channels. Once published to the network, it may still remain on someone's device even if you choose to delete it later.

Some users may be running out-of-date versions of Status, or custom builds that do not support message editing and deletion by choice. Such users will still see your original message, even after you ask the network to edit or delete it.

## Edit your messages

1. Long press the message you want to edit.
2. Select :mobile-edit: **Edit message**.
3. Make your changes.
4. Tap :mobile-send: **Send** to publish your changes.

## Delete your messages

1. Long press the message you want to delete.
2. Select :mobile-delete: **Delete Message**.
