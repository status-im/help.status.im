# Edit and delete your messages

You can edit and delete your Status messages with no time limitations. Note that instead of a centralized server, Status uses a [peer-to-peer network][about-status-messages]{:target="_blank"} to store and display messages. If you edit or delete your message, these changes will need to be distributed by the network for other members to see them.

This means that some users will still see your original message, even after you edit or delete it. For example, someone may be running an out-of-date version of Status, or a custom build that does not support message editing and deletion by choice.

!!! note
    Be careful with what you share, especially in public channels. Once published to the network, it may still remain on someone's device even if you choose to delete it later.

## Edit your messages
