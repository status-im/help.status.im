# Edit and delete your messages

Instead of a centralized server, Status uses a [peer-to-peer network][about-status-messages]{:target="_blank"} to store and distribute messages. When you edit or delete a message, the peer-to-peer network distributes your changes to other users running the Status app.

In some cases, users may still see your original messages, even after you edit or delete them:

- Users run an out-of-date version of the Status app that is not fully compatible with the peer-to-peer network features.
- A user runs a custom build of the Status app that does not support message editing and deletion by choice.
- The user disconnects from the network before fetching your changes.

!!! note
    Be careful with what you share, especially in public channels. Once published to the network, it may still remain on someone's device even if you choose to delete it later.

### What to expect

- You can edit and delete your Status messages with no time limitations.
- You can only edit text messages. If you want to change a message that contains media content, consider deleting and re-sending it.
- Once you edit a message, a permanent note will appear next to your message saying it was edited.
