# Create a group chat

Group chats are conversations of more than 2 people. To invite someone to a group chat, you need to have them on your contact list. 

Group chats are different to communities, as they're meant to unite smaller groups of people or be centred around specific topics. For more information about group chats, see [Understand group chats][understand-group-chats]{:target="_blank"}.

## What to expect

- You can invite up to 20 members to your group chat. If you need more, consider [creating a community][create-a-status-community]{:target="_blank"}.
- Once you create your group chat, you can [customize it][customize-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"} and [add members][add-members-to-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"}, as well as [remove them][remove-members-from-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"}.
