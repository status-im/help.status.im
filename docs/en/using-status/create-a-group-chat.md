# Create a group chat

Group chats are conversations of more than two people. To invite someone to a group chat, you need to have them on your Status contact list.

Group chats are different to communities, as they're meant to unite smaller groups of people or be centred around specific topics. For more information about group chats, see [Understand group chats][understand-group-chats]{:target="_blank"}.

## What to expect

- You can invite up to 20 members to your group chat. If you need more, consider [creating a community][create-a-status-community]{:target="_blank"}.
- Once you create your group chat, you can [customize it][customize-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"} and [add members][add-members-to-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"}, as well as [remove them][remove-members-from-a-group-chat]{:target="_blank"}. 
- Group chats are always end-to-end [encrypted][about-status-messages/#built-in-privacy-and-security] with secure cryptographic keys. Only the group chat members will have access to the messages in it. Status doesn't have the keys and can't access any messages by design.
