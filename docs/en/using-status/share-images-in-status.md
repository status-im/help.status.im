# Share images in Status

!!! note ""
    Sharing images is not available on Status Web.

In Status, conversations happen across channels, group chats and DMs (direct messages). To enrich your communication and make it more personal, you can share images. When you share an image on Status, other participants can download, react or answer to it.

Contrary to other messaging apps using a centralised server, Status protects your privacy using a peer-to-peer network to deliver your messages. Due to this [peer-to-peer network][about-status-messages], you are limited in how many images you can share within a message. However, you can share as many images as you want in different messages.

!!! note
    At present, sharing files isn't possible on the Status peer-to-peer network.
