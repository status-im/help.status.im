# Share pictures in Status

In Status, conversations happen across public chats and DMs (direct messages). To help you to interact with your contacts in Status, you can share pictures. Learn how to share pictures on DMs to improve your conversations.

You can share a maximum of 5 pictures per massage and up to 0.5MB in size per picture. Because status does not have a central server and relies on a [peer-to-peer network] [about-status-messages] for messaging, sharing bigger pictures is not possible. This is also the reason you can not share files in status.

!!! note

     Share images are currently only available on desktop and mobile.
