1. We're working on this page

Your Status display name is how you want people to know you. It's the part
of your identity along with the [chatkey, emojihash, and identicon ring]
[your-chatkey-emojihash-and-identicon-ring]. You have several ways to make
the display name suitable for you.

During the onboarding process, type your display name in the text format. Later
you can change it any time. See the page
[Change your Status display name][change-your-status-display-name]
to learn how you can do it.

### The basics

- A text display name appears from the beginning when you run the Status
  app for the first time.

- ENS (Ethereum Name Service) name is an ENS identifier such as `alice.eth`.
  Names may consist of multiple parts, called labels, separated by dots.

- The Status ENS name is the ENS name with the Status prefix. The Status app
  offers to use the `.stateofus.eth` domain for your Status ENS name.

- You can add your ENS name or make the Status ENS name using the Status
  Desktop or Mobile app.

## ENS names vs. text name

- An ENS name or the Status ENS name can replace your text display name in
  chats.

- The text name is free of charge.

- An ENS name costs from 5$ annually and has limits of ownership.

- The Status ENS name costs 10SNT for a year. After the first year of
  ownership, you can return your funds. Thus, the Status ENS name is free
  of charge for a year and stays with you forever.

- By using an ENS or Status ENS name, you can make your display name unique. 
  In any Community, users can use identical text names as a display name.

[register-your-status-ens-name] page.
