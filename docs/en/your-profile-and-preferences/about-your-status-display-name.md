# About your Status display name

1. We're working on this page

Your Status display name is how you want people to identify you. It's a part
of your identity along with the [chatkey, emojihash, and identicon ring]
[your-chatkey-emojihash-and-identicon-ring]. In general, a display name is 
the name that users can see in Communities and direct messages.

You have several ways to make the display name suitable for you.
During the signup process, type out your display name in text format. You 
can change it any time afterwords. See the page
[Change your Status display name][change-your-status-display-name]
to learn how to do it.

### The basics

- You already have a chosen display name when you run the Status
  app for the first time.

- An ENS ([https://ens.domains][Ethereum Name Service]) name is a domain name 
  such as `alice.eth`.
  Names may consist of multiple parts, called labels, separated by dots.

- The Status ENS name is the ENS name with the Status prefix. The Status app
  offers the use of the `.stateofus.eth` domain for your Status ENS name.

- You can add your ENS name or register the Status ENS name using the Status
  Desktop or Mobile app.

## ENS names vs. chosen name

- An ENS name or the Status ENS name can replace your chosen display name in
  channels.

- The text name is free of charge.

- An ENS name has an annual fee and limits of ownership.

- The Status ENS name has a one-time fee. After the first year of
  ownership, you can have your funds reimbursed by releasing your name; 
  however, it stays with you indefinitely if you decide to leave it.

- By using an ENS or Status ENS name, you can make your display name unique. 
  By contrast, in any Community, more than one user can choose an identical 
  name as their display name.

[register-your-status-ens-name] page.

### Limitations of the text display name

There are a few simple rules for the Display name:

- You can use only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
- Usernames ending with `_eth` and `-eth` aren't allowed.
- A display name can't be more than 24 characters long.
