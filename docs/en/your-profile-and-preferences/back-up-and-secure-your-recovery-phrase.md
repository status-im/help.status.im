# Back up and secure your recovery phrase

Your Status recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase or backup phrase) consists of 12 words that can be used to regenerate your [private key][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase]. If you lose your private key or it is compromised, you lose access to your Status profile and funds forever. For this reason, you must always backup your recovery phrase and keep it safe.

## Secure your recovery phrase

If you lose your recovery phrase or someone else gets access to it, you lose access to your Status profile and funds in the [Status Wallet][status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.md].

Here are some tips on how to keep your recovery phrase secure:

- **Keep it safe**

    Use a paper backup, writing down your recovery phrase on a piece of paper and saving this paper in a locked safe, at the very least. This is the most common backup method, but it's not the most secure. Consider using a hardware wallet in addition to your paper backup.

- **Avoid digital copies**

    Don't take a screenshot of your recovery phrase and don't save your recovery phrase on your phone, computer or any online service.

- **Keep it secret**

    Do not share the seed phrase with anyone, and be careful about who has access to the information.

- **Use a hardware wallet**

    Hardware wallets add an extra layer of security to your seed phrase. The [Keycard][about-keycard] hardware wallet integrates with the Status app and is compatible with all major cryptocurrencies.

- **Use multiple backups**

    You can combine different backup methods, such as paper backup and a hardware wallet. In addition, you can improve the security of your paper backups by dividing up your recovery phrase words and storing them in different places.

!!! note
    Keep your recovery phrase safe, and never share this information with anyone. Status will never ask you for this information.
