# Sync your profile across devices

If you use Status on more than one device, sync your profile so that it's up to date on every device and you can switch between them seamlessly. Without syncing, you are likely to configure the same options more than once and receive multiple notifications for one single message.

Currently, you can only set up syncing using the Status mobile app, but you can pair a computer using your phone.
<!---This feature will be available on Desktop in the next major release, I'll update this article when the new release comes out.--->

## What to expect

- You can pair up to three devices.
- Once you set up the syncing, your Status profile data on your devices are in sync automatically until you unpair the devices.
- Your profile data include your message status (read or unread) and configuration for the profile, messaging, notification, wallets and browser.
- Your messages are not part of your profile data. When you sync a new device, only the messages sent or received in the last 30 days are available on your new device. Messages you receive from that initial sync are always available.
- If you have multiple profiles, you need to set up syncing for each one of them.

## Sync your profile on a new device

If you open Status on a device for the first time, you can log into an existing profile by syncing.

=== "Mobile"
    
    ### In Status on your logged-in device
    
    1. From the tab bar, tap **Messages**.
    1. Tap your profile photo and go to :mobile-syncing: **Syncing**. 
    1. Tap :desktop-plus: **Add**. 
    1. Tap :mobile-reveal: **Reveal sync code** and confirm your credentials.
    
    ### In Status on your new device
    
    1. Tap **Sign in**.
    1. Tap :mobile-camera: **Enable camera** to scan the QR code shown on your first device or tap **Enter sync code** to enter the sync code.

!!! tip
    During the syncing process, make sure Status is running on both devices and connected to the internet. You can see the validity period of the QR code and the sync code under the QR code. If the codes expire, confirm your profile credentials again and get new ones.

## Sync your profile on a logged-in device

If you have logged into an account on multiple devices, you can set up syncing on any of your devices.

1. Tap :mobile-syncing: **Syncing**.
1. In the **Paired with this device** list, tap **Unpair**.
