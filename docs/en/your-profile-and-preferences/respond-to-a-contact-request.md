# Respond to a contact request

Status Users with access to your profile can send you contact requests. For example, users you have shared your profile with or those in mutual communities or group chats with you.

!!! tip
    If you want to send a contact request, check out [Add a contact in Status][add-a-contact-in-status].

## What to expect

- Contact requests expire after seven days.
- Status users can send you a new request every seven days. If it bothers you, consider [blocking the user][block-stranger].
- Rejecting a request does not notify the sender.
