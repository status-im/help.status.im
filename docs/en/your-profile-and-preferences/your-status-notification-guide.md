# Your Status notification guide

With Status, you can [set up notifications][configure-your-notification-settings] that keep you updated, whether you're at your desk or on the go. Notification settings let you choose how and when you'd like to receive notifications. Among the options offered in this setting are enabling or disabling notifications, specifying the type of notifications to be received, and setting up the delivery method.

Status gives you total control over notifications, and to get that type of control, you can configure [exceptions for notifications][set-your-notification-exceptions].

=== "1- Mark as read"
    This option is used to keep track of which messages have been read and which have not, making it easier for you to quickly find and respond to unread messages.

=== "2- Mute"
    When you use Mute, you no longer receive messages from a particular person, group chat, community, or channel. For example, if you are in a community but do not want to receive messages from a specific channel, you can mute that channel. This action only affects the channel you muted, not the whole community or other channels.

=== "3- Notification settings"
    Notification settings let you choose how and when you'd like to receive notifications.

=== "4- All other messages"
    This option allows you to be notified of all messages that other users send in a community, channel or group chat.

=== "5- Reset to default notification settings"
    Resetting to default notification settings refers to the option of returning all notification settings on a device or application to their original default settings.

    You can find more information about your default notification options in the article [Configure your notifications settings][configure-your-notification-settings].

!!!note
    Since you are already in a personal conversation with another person, the option of personal mention and global mention is not available in DMs. It wouldn't matter if you used a tag of a personal or global mention in a DM chat since those tags are meant for chats with more than two people.
