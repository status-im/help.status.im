# Mute your notifications

You can mute and unmute your [notifications][your-status-notification-guide] for the whole app, communities, channels, group chats and DMs for a period of time. You'll still receive messages, but you will only see a numbered badge next to conversations if you are mentioned. Muted communities, group chats, channels, and DMs will appear greyed out.

!!! note
    If you want to customise your notifications and not completely mute a community, group chat, channel or DM, you can use [notification exceptions][set-your-notification-exceptions] which are extremely flexible and granular.
