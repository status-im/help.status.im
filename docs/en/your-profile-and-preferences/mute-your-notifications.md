# Mute your notifications

You can mute and unmute your [notifications][your-status-notification-guide] for communities, chat groups, channels and DMs for a period of time. Messages will still come in, but you will only see a numbered badge next to conversations if you are mentioned. Muted communities, chat groups, channels, and DMs will appear greyed out.

!!! note
    If you want to customise your notifications and not completely mute a community, group chat, channel or DM, you can use [notification exceptions][set-your-notification-exceptions] which are extremely flexible and granular.

=== "Mobile"

    1. Long press the community, channel, chat group or DM you want to mute.
    1. Tap :desktop-mute: mute.
    1. Select the length of time you'd like to mute your notifications.

=== "Desktop"

    1. Right click the community, channel, chat group or DM you want to mute.
    1. Click :desktop-notification: mute.
    1. Select the length of time you'd like to mute your notifications.
