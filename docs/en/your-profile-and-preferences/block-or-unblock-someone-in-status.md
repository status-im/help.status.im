# Block or unblock someone in Status

You can block a stranger or an existing contact to stop receiving harmful content and excluding the user entirely from your experience with Status.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Blocking someone deletes all messages from the user. Status can't recover them for you.

## What to expect

- Blocked users don't receive any notifications or see any changes. They only know that you have stopped messaging them.
- You can't see any messages sent by blocked users, including direct messages and messages in mutual group chats, channels, and communities.
- A blocked user can see your previous direct messages and future messages you send in mutual group chats, channels, and communities.
- Status permanently deletes all messages sent by the blocked user, including direct messages and messages in mutual group chats, channels, and communities.
- Unblocking a user does not restore deleted messages.
- Status stops showing blocked users as mutual contacts.
