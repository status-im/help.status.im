# Customize membership request notifications

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only customize membership request notifications using  Status mobile.

If you require [manual approval][manage-community-join-requests] to join your community, you receive a notification for every member who wants to join your community.  

You have three different notification preferences: `Notification on`, `In notification centre only` and `Notifications off`. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

!!! note
    Because there is no way to costumize notifications on desktop you have the option to mute the notification sound if you are receiving too many notification requests.
