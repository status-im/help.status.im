# Customize community and channel notifications

Any member of an existing community or channel can set up their notification settings in three different options: [`mute messages`](link), [`mention people`](link) and [`set up exceptions`](link). Using these options, you receive notifications only from those communities or channels that are relevant to you. 

This article describes common examples.

- [Set the same settings for all community messages types.](#set-the-same-settings-for-all-community-messages-types)
