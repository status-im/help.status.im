# Create and use additional Status profiles

In Status, a profile enables you to sign in and access Status services. Unlike traditional chat apps which require personal information like a phone number to sign up, Status does not ask you for any personal information.

You can create multiple profiles for different purposes. For example, you may want to use different profiles for work, social activities and connecting with families.

!!! note
    If you want to remove a profile, read [Remove a Status profile][remove-a-status-profile].
