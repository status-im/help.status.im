# Create and use additional Status profiles

Using your Status profile, you can access and use the different Status app features. Unlike traditional centralized apps which require personal information like a phone number to sign up, Status doesn't ask you for any personal information.

You can create multiple profiles for different purposes. For example, you may want to use different profiles for work, social activities and connecting with families.

!!! note
    If you want to remove a profile, read [Remove a Status profile][remove-a-status-profile].

## Create an additional profile

To create an additional profile, you follow a similar process to creating your first profile.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**, then tap your profile picture.
    1. From the top navigation, tap :mobile-multi-profile: **Profiles**.
    1. Tap :desktop-plus: **Add**, and then tap :desktop-plus: **Create a new profile**.
    1. Read [Create a new Status profile][new-profile] and follow the instructions.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-settings: **Settings** > :desktop-signout: **Sign out and quit**.
