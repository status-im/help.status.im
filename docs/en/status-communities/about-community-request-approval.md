# About community request approval <!--include a plural on request or approval? ASk Emma-->

When a community requires [manual approval][link-here] for membership requests, the community owner reviews each request and decides based on their criteria. If you're a community owner and want to configure manual approval, read [set up your community's approval options][link to the article].

!!! tip
    In addition to manual approval, community owners may configure [token requirements][] to join their communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.

Once you send a request to [join a community][join-a-status-community], your request can be accepted or not. To check the status of your request, go to the community screen.

If the community owner approves your request to join, you get access to the community immediately.
