# About community request approval

When a community requires [manual approval][link-here] for membership requests, the community owner reviews each request and makes a decision based on their own criteria.

If you request to [join a community][join-a-status-community] on the Status app that requires manual approval, there are three possible outcomes for your request: accepted, timeout, or not accepted.

## Accepted

## Timeout

Your request will automatically expire if the community owner does not respond within 7 days. <!--maybe explain here that the output message for timeout and not accept is the same -->

!!!note 
    You can request to join a community as many times as you want. <!--You're free to request to join a community as many times as you'd like.-->

## Not accepted

If the community owner denies your request to join, you won't be able to access the community.
