# Replace your community's control node

The computer where you create your Status Community and every computer where you run Status desktop and restore your community's private key becomes a [community control node][about-the-control-node-in-status-communities]. You can replace the Status desktop running as the control node if you need to reinstall Status desktop or it becomes unavailable.

The community control node maintains the settings, configuration and functionality of your community. Keep the Status desktop app where you set up your community running and connected to the internet as much as possible, or at least once every six days.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Don't use more than one installation of Status desktop as your community's control node. Running your community with multiple control nodes will cause unforeseen issues and increase your community's bandwidth requirements.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Only proceed if you have a copy of your community's private key and recovery phrase. If you proceed without this information, you will lose your Status profile and community.

- [x] Verify that your profile in both the new and the previous Status desktop installations [are in sync][sync-your-profile-across-devices]. The sync process may take some time to complete.
