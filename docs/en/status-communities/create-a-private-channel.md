# Create a private channel

!!! note ""
    Create a private channel is only available in Status desktop.

With Status, you can organize your conversations with your contacts into designated spaces called [channels][channels-your-quick-start-guide]. Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

In Status, you can create a private channel if you are the community's owner or admin. A channel owner must specify token requirements to create a private channel.
