# Import a community someone shares with you

You can import a Status Community someone [shares with you][invite-people-to-a-status-community] using the link, QR code or community's public key. Importing a community can also be helpful when you need help finding the community.

!!! note
    If you're a community owner and want to restore your community on a different device, read [Restore your Status Community][restore-your-status-community].

## Import community options

You have three options to import a Status Community.

| Option | Description | Works with |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Link | Tap or click the Status Community link to open the community page. | Mobile and desktop |
| QR code | Use this option to scan the community QR code someone shares with you. | Mobile |
| Community's public key | Import the key using the Status app to find the community you want to join. | Mobile and desktop |

Use the community link, QR code or public key to find and import the community you're interested in. Status includes the community's public key in the QR code or link, like this: `https://join.status.im/c/zQ3shMtRomXyM5svciMpdK7zDaR12XDeQWbzi4Fb8E6YywDrE`. The link contains the community's public key at the end, so you don't have to type it in.
