# About community request approvals

When a community requires manual approval for membership requests, the community owner reviews each request and makes a decision based on their criteria. If you're a community owner and want to set up manual approval, check out [set up your community's approval options][set-up-your-communitys-approval-options].

!!! tip
    In addition to manual approval, community owners can set up [token requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-communities] to join their communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.

Once you send a request to [join a community][join-a-status-community], your request can be accepted or not. To check the status of your request, go to the community screen.

If the community owner approves your request to join, you get access to the community immediately.
