# Leave a channel

There are two kinds of [Status channels](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.md): open and token-gated. Once you join a community, you can access all its open channels. You can access the token-gated channels only by [meeting and maintaining the requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md). You cannot leave a channel, but you can lose access to it. The cases are listed below.

* You [leave the community](./how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide.md) 
* You got [banned or kicked from the community](./about-losing-access-to-a-community.md)
* Since you no longer [hold the required tokens](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md), you cannot access a token-gated channel
