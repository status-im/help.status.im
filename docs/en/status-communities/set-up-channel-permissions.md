# Set up channel permissions

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only set up channel permissions using Status desktop.

Community owners can set up permissions using three different variables: `Who holds`, `Is allowed to` and `In`. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

## What to expect

- Using channel permissions, community owners can restrict channel access and actions to specific people based on token requirements.
- Only the community owner can set up channel permissions.
- Use [community permissions][set-up-a-token-gated-community] to make the entire community token-gated. You can combine community-level and channel-level permission in the same community.
- When you delete a token-gated channel, the channel permissions are lost. If you recreate the channel, you need to set up its permission again.

## Set up channel permission

=== "Desktop"

1. If you're not in the **New permissions** screen, click **Community > Settings > Permissions**.
1. Click **Add permission**.
1. For the `Who holds`, `Is allowed to` and `In` variables, click :desktop-plus: **Add** next to the variable and choose your values. Use the table below for reference.
