# About losing access to a channel

There are two types of channels in [Status Communities][about-status-communities]: [open and token-gated][channels-your-quick-start-guide]. When you join a community, you automatically have access to all open channels and token-aged channels where you meet the [channel requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels].

!!! tip
    Token-gated channels show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to the channel name.

You can lose access to a channel for two reasons:

- You lose access to the community. Check [About losing access to a community][about-losing-access-to-a-community] for more information.
- You no longer [hold the required tokens][understand-token-requirements-in-channels] in a token-gated channel. If you lose access to a token-gated channel, you must request to [join the channel][join-a-channel] again.
