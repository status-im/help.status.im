# Understand token requirements in channels

In Status, there are two kinds of channels: open and token-gated. If you want to [join a token-gated channel][join-a-channel], you need to meet the token requirements. To maintain access to a token-gated channel, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

For example, a community owner can set up owning 15 SNT as a requirement to join a channel. In that case, you need a minimum of 15 SNT in your [Status Wallet][status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide] to join that channel.

There are three kinds of tokens in the Status app: assets, collectibles and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names. Community owners can set up any combination of these tokens as a requirement to join a channel.

!!! note
    When you join a token-gated channel, the token or tokens required to join are not transferred to anyone. They are used for verification purposes only, and they remain in your possession and wallet.

## If you meet the requirements

Before you join a token-gated channel, the Status app automatically checks if you meet the channel requirements. If you meet the requirements, the option to join the channel is available.

!!! note
    If the community owner has set [manual approval][manage-community-join-requests] option for the channel, you still need the owner's approval to join.

## If you don't meet the token requirements

If the request option is unavailable, it means that you don't meet the token requirements to join a channel in the Status app. To join the channel, you must have the required token amount. To buy the required tokens, read [Buy crypto][buy-crypto].
