# How to use Status Communities: your quick start guide

The Status app combines a privacy-first messaging app, a non-custodial crypto wallet and a web3 browser to interact with dApps. At the core of Status' messaging are Communities. Status Communities can be defined as a platform that allows users to create, join, and engage in groups centred around shared interests or topics. 

With Status, you can create your own community or become part of an existing one. To start with your community, check out  

## Discover Communities

When you open the Status, the :mobile-communities: Communities brings the list of communities where you participate. If can also access the Community Directory

The Communities Directory shows the list of communities you can join. However, private communites don't show up in this directory. This communities are intentionlly hidden from the directory and you need the public's community key to join them. If you know some member of a private community, you can ask this member to share the puclic's community key with you and then, import the key in your Status app.

!!! note
    Private communities may still require tokens and join request to join them.

## Join communities

In Status, community owners have complete control over how users can join their community. Owners can configure token requirements and manual approval to join the community

When token requirements are set, you need to own and maintain the required tokens to join the community. 

!!! note
    Your tokens serve as a proof of ownership and are never transfer to the community owner, Status or someone else.

## Participate in communities and channels

Status Communities are made out of channels. Think of channels as rooms, each with its unique theme, helping to keep discussions focused and organized. Access to these channels can also be controlled via tokens or other permissions set by the community owner. Some channels might require additional tokens, while others could grant access but in a read-only mode, letting you view discussions but not contribute.

!!! Note
    Respect the community rules and members, and don't spam people or promote scams or deceptive practices.

Similarly to token-based communities, different channels within a community may have varyging levels of access. Some channels might be open to all members, while other could be restricted or have rea-only access.

Inside channels, you can participate in the conversation using the messaging tools available in direct messsage or group chats. Use the notification filters to tailor community and channel notifications to your taste.

## Status communities privacy and security

Communities within Status are fully decentralized, meaning they are self-governed and not managed by Status.
