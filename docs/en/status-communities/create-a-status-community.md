# Create a Status Community

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only create and administer communities using the Status desktop app.</br><p style="text-align: center;">[Download Status desktop :octicons-desktop-download-16:][status-web-download]{ .md-button }

A Status Community is a place where you can connect and communicate with people who share your interests. Communities are ideal for those with a passion or hobby, study groups, gaming communities, professional network groups, or creators looking to generate income from their content without intermediaries.

As a community owner, you can [restrict community access using tokens][configure-your-community-permissions], control which users are added to the community and organize discussion groups in [channels][create-a-channel]. Owners have complete control over their community and are responsible for maintaining its rules.

## Create a community

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click :desktop-communities: **Communities**.
    1. On top of the content area, click **Create community** and then, click **Create new**.
    1. Add a **name** and a **short description** of your community.
    1. Optionally, add a **logo**, **banner**, **colour** palette and **tags**. You can [customize these settings](#customize-your-community) at any time.
    1. Configure [additional community settings](#configure-additional-settings).
    1. Click **Next** to complete the [information about your community](#describe-your-community-and-its-rules).
    1. Click **Create community**.

## Configure additional settings

You can configure these community settings:

| Setting | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Community history service** | Status Communities store up to 30 days of chat history by default. When this option is checked, community members can see messages older than 30 days.</br></br>For more information, check out [About the Community history service][about-the-community-history-service].|
| **Request to join required** | Community owners must manually approve each join request if this setting is checked. This option applies to [open and private][about-status-communities] communities. |
| **Any member can pin a message** | Any community member can [pin messages][pin-a-message] when this setting is checked. If the setting is unchecked, only the community owner can pin messages. |

!!! note
    The Community history service uses the [BitTorrent peer-to-peer network :octicons-tab-external-16:][bittorrent-peer-to-peer-network]{:target="_blank"} to store and retrieve community messages older than 30 days. Status uses a decentralized network and does not store this information.

    1. In the **Leaving community message**, write the message sent to members leaving your community.
    1. Click **Create community** if you haven't already.

## Customize your community

After you create a community, you can customize its settings at any time.
