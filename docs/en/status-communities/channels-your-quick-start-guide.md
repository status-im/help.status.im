# Channels: your quick start guide

In [Status Communities][how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide], you have access to dedicated spaces called channels. Channels bring the right people and information together for any project or topic. A channel conversation focuses on specific topics, and you can [join](./join-a-channel.md) and [leave](./leave-a-channel.md) the conversation anytime.

As a community owner, you can use channels to break down a large community into smaller, more focused sub-groups. With Status, you can [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions] based on token ownership. For example, you can make a public channel private or view-only by only allowing holders of specific tokens to join or post.

!!! tip
    To add channels to your community, check out [Create a channel][create-a-channel].

=== ":mobile-one: Channel information"
    You can see the channel name and permissions here. Private channels have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon. From this area, you can select :mobile-more-options: **More options** to view more details about the channel, such as channel members, permissions or notifications.

=== ":mobile-two: Pinned message area"
    Channel members can [pin messages][pin-a-message] to this area, such as announcements, FAQ or channel rules.

=== ":mobile-three: Channel feed"
    This area shows the channel activity, including messages, photos, reactions or links.

=== ":mobile-four: Message field"
    From here, you can send messages to channel members with [text][send-and-read-messages], [images][share-images-in-status] or emojis, as well as [audio messages][send-an-audio-message].

## The #general channel

The #general channel is created by default when you [create a community][create-a-status-community]. You can use this channel for various purposes, including sharing news, discussing community policies and events or making announcements.

This channel works like any other channel. As a community administrator, here's how you can make this channel more helpful:

- Don't rename the channel. The #general channel is widely recognized and understood in communities. Renaming the channel may confuse members.
- [Set up permissions][configure-channel-permissions] to restrict who can post in #general. This removes noise from the channel and keeps it on topic.
- Use the #general channel to [pin messages][pin-a-message] describing FAQs, community rules or other information relevant to your community.
