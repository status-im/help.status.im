# Channels: your quick start guide

In [Status communities](./about-status-communities.md), you have acess to dedicated spaces called [channels](./join-a-channel.md). Channels bring the right people and information together for any project or topic. Unlike email, discussions in channels are focused around specific topics, so you can [join](./join-a-channel.md) and [leave](./leave-a-channel.md) them as needed.

Since Status.im is based on an anti-censorship concept, everything you post in an encrypted channel is private, so only members of that channel can read it.

!!!Note 

Channels end-to-end encryption is guaranteed when the community is encrypted. For more information check [Create a Status community](./create-a-status-community.md).
