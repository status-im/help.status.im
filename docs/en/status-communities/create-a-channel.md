# Create a channel

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only create a channel using Status desktop.

Community owners can create open and closed channels in the Status app. All community members can browse and join open channels. To join closed channels, members must meet the [channel requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels]. As a community owner, you can set up specific permissions to create a closed channel.

## Create a channel

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community where you want to create a channel.
    1. In the **Community** sidebar, right-click the empty space and select **Create Channel**.
    1. Type your **Channel name**. Optionally, click :desktop-emojis: **Emoji** to choose an emoji.
    1. Optionally, choose a **Channel colour** and add a **Description** of your channel.
    1. Click **Create Channel**.

If you need to set up additional permissions, click **Add permissions** and check out [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions]. For example, you can create a view-only announcement channel or a channel all members can view and post in.
