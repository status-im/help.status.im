# Delete a channel

!!! note ""
    Delete a channel is only available in Status desktop.

With Status, you can organize your conversations with your contacts into designated spaces called [channels](channels-your-quick-start-guide.md). Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

The Status app allows you to delete channels within communities. When you delete a channel, all content connected to it is deleted, including messages and files.

!!! warning "caution"

    Is important to be aware that deleting a channel is permanent and cannot be undone.

## What to expect

* A deleted channel disappears immediately, and all users will lose access to that channel and its content (messages and files).

* Deleted channels are not visible to you as a community member.

* Deleting a channel is permanent; it cannot be undone.

    1. In the channel sidebar, right-click on the channel that you want to delete.
