# Delete a channel

!!! note ""
    Currently, you can only delete a channel using Status desktop.

Community owners can delete [channels][channels-your-quick-start-guide] within their communities. As a community owner, when you delete a channel, all messages and files associated with that channel are also deleted.

!!! Note

    Once you delete a channel, it can't be retrieved or restored.

## What to expect

* You can only delete a channel if you are the community owner.

* When you delete a channel, it disappears immediately, and all users lose access to its content (messages and files).

* If you delete a token-gated channel, the [permissions][configure-channel-permissions] you configured for the channel are also lost. If you want to recreate the channel, you need to configure its permissions again.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community with the channel you want to delete.
    1. In the **Community** sidebar, right-click the channel.
    1. Select :desktop-delete: **Delete Channel**.
    1. In the **Delete** pop-up window, click **Delete**.
