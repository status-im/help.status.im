## Common questions

### What are the three words in my profile?

These words represent your throwaway profile and identity in Status Web. These are randomly generated words.

### Is my throwaway profile really anonymous?

A throwaway profile protects your real identity while using Status Web. However, your internet service provider and browser can still collect identifiable information (like your IP address). Status doesn't collect information about you or your activity.

### Where is the throwaway profile information stored?

Your browser cache stores your throwaway profile. You can delete this information by disconnecting your profile, clearing the cache, or using your browser incognito or private mode.

### I accidentally deleted my throwaway profile. Can I recover it?

No. Deleting a throwaway profile is an irreversible process.

### Can I use more than one throwaway profile?

There is only one throwaway profile per browser. If you want to use a new throwaway profile, delete the existing one or use a different browser.
