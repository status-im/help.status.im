# Use a throwaway profile in Status Web

!!! note ""
    Throwaway profiles are only available in Status Web.

A throwaway profile is a disposable Status profile that you can use to join Communities in Status Web. Using a throwaway profile can be helpful when you want to participate in a Status Web Community without revealing your identity. Because the throwaway profile is not linked to any identifiable information or other Status profile you may have, your identity remains anonymous.

You may want to use a throwaway profile for different reasons. For example:

- You want to discuss sensitive or personal information anonymously.
- To participate in a Status Web Community without revealing your identity.
- You want to write about an embarrassing or stigmatizing topic.

## About throwaway profiles in Status Web

When you use a throwaway profile, Status Web assigns a randomly generated profile using three words: adjective, adjective, and animal name. This mechanism uses significant randomization and preservers user anonymity.

A throwaway profile protects your identity from others. However, people may find your real identity based on the information you share.

## Use a throwaway profile in Status Web

=== "Web"

    1. From the Community sidebar, click **Use throwaway profile**.

## Common questions

### Is a throwaway account really private?

Status doesn't collect information about you, but your internet service provider and browser can collect identifiable information (like your IP address). So don't use a throwaway account for anything illegal, dangerous, or hateful.

### How can I delete my throwaway account information?

The throwaway profile information remains in your browser and persists across browser sessions and operating system reboots. Therefore, to completely delete any trace of your throwaway account, you should clear your browser's cache.

### Is there any limit to the number of throwaway account I can use?
