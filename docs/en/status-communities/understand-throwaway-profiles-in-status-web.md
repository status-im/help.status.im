    Throwaway profiles are only available in Status Web.

A throwaway profile is a disposable Status profile that you can use to join Communities in Status Web.

Because the throwaway profile is not linked to any identifiable information or other Status profile you may have, your identity remains anonymous.

You may want to use a throwaway profile for different reasons. For example:

- Discussing sensitive or personal information anonymously.
- Joining a Status Web Community without revealing your identity.
- Writing about embarrassing or stigmatizing topics.
