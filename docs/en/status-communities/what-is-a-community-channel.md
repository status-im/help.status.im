# What's a Community channel?

1. We're working on this page

Status Communities organize people's communication into channels.
A channel is a dedicated space where people talk, share ideas,
have discussions, and post content.

Community channels usually unite a common topic for conversations and 
discussions.
Using channels, each Community avoids the risk of letting 
conversations fall into disarray.

### The basics

<!---
- A Community channel has permission settings that allow you to set up 
  channel access flexibly. Using these settings, you can make private 
  channels in a Community.
--->

- Each user sees all channels inside the Community after joining it.
- Users can't delete channels, but they can mute unwanted channels.
- Categories help to organize channels by topic.
- Users can create channels as well as categories for their needs.

## Main channel features

You can use these features to maintain Community channels:

- **Mute** — make unwanted channels silent
- **Mark as read** — mark all unread messages in a channel as read
- **Clear history** — delete message history in a channel

## The #general channel

When you create a Community, the **#general** channel is already there by 
default.
This channel is typically used for announcements and general discussions.

## Tips and best practices

- Use the **#general** channel to view the FAQ as well as pinned 
  messages describing the rules of a Community.
- Make sure that all channels you create or maintain contain a topic and clear 
  description so that people understand what they’re used for.
- Delete channels when they're no longer used.
