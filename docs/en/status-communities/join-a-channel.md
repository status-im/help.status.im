# Join a channel

With Status, you can organize your conversations with your contacts into designated spaces called [channels](channels-your-quick-start-guide.md). Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

All members of a [community](about-status-communities.md) can browse and join open channels. For token-gated channels, you must [meet the requirements](understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md) to join the channel. To maintain access to token-gated channels, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

## Join an open channel

Channels that do not show a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon are open for anyone to join. When you join a community, you automatically have access to these channels.
