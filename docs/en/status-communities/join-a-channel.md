# Join a channel

With Status, you can organize your conversations with community members into designated spaces called [channels](channels-your-quick-start-guide.md). Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

All members of a [community](about-status-communities.md) can browse and join open channels. For closed channels, you must [meet the requirements](understand-token-requirements-in-channels.md) to join the channel. To maintain access to closed channels, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

## Join an open channel

All members can join channels that don't have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to their names. When you join a community, you automatically get access to these channels.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**.
    1. Tap the community with the channel you want to join.
    1. Tap on the open channel.

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community with the channel you want to join.
    1. In the channel sidebar, click the open channel.

## Join a closed channel

Closed channels have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon next to their names. To access these channels, you need to meet the token requirements. To maintain access, you need to keep holding the required tokens.

=== "Mobile"

    1. From the tab bar, tap :mobile-communities: **Communities**.
