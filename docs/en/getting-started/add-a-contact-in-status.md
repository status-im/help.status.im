# Add a contact in Status

To start a chat with someone, you first need to add them to your contacts.

After sending a contact request, wait for the other person to accept it. Once they do that, both you and them can send each other [direct messages][send-direct-messages-to-your-contacts] and invite each other to [group chats][add-members-to-a-group-chat].

If the person you want to chat with doesn't have a Status profile yet, you can [invite them to join Status][invite-friends-to-status].

To add someone to your contact list, you need their [chat key][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase], which represents their public Status profile. They can share it with you, so ask them to [Share their Status profile with you][share-your-status-profile]. You can also use their QR code to add them to contacts.

!!! tip
    To add someone you know from a group chat or community, simply right-click their name and select :desktop-add-user: **Send a contact request**.

!!! tip
    To respond to contact requests, check out [Respond to a contact request][respond-to-a-contact-request].
