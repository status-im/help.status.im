# Create or restore your Status profile using the recovery phrase

You can link your existing Ethereum address to a new Status profile. For instance, if you already have a [non-custodial Ethereum wallet][status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide] such as Metamask or Trust Wallet, you already have an Ethereum address and a [recovery phrase][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase].

If you already have a Status account and used your profile in the past 30 days, you can restore it with the profile's recovery phrase.

!!! tip
    If you already use Status on one device and want to add your profile and funds to a new device, you don't need your recovery phrase. [Sync your new device][add-a-new-device-to-your-status-profile] for the best experience.

## What to expect

- Your wallet funds are safe and recoverable as long as you know your recovery phrase and [keep it safe][back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase].
- When you import an existing Ethereum address from a wallet, you can operate with your funds using [Status Wallet][how-to-use-wallet-your-quick-start-guide].
- If you already use Status but don't have access to your previous device, you can restore your Status profile on a new device if you have used the app within the past 30 days.
- If you don't have access to your previous device and haven't used Status in the past 30 days, your funds are safe, but your profile is unrecoverable. You can still use your recovery phrase to create a new profile, but your previous profile configuration (contacts, profile settings and community membership) is lost.

This table summarizes your options when you have a recovery phrase:
