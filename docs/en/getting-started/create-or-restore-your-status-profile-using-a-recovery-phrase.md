You can use your existing Ethereum address to create your Status profile. For example, if you already use a [non-custodial crypto wallet][how-to-use-wallet-your-quick-start-guide] for the Ethereum ecosystem (like Metamask or Trust Wallet), you already have an Ethereum address and a recovery phrase. If you don't want to use your existing recovery phrase (or can't find it), [create a new Status profile][run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time].

If you no longer have access to your previous device but have used Status in the last 30 days, use this procedure to restore your Status profile with your recovery phrase.
